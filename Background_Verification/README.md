## Last Released:

## Descripton
Business Challenge:

Currently, there is a gap in SAP SuccessFactors that has to do with accessing candidate information for background checks. SuccessFactors also has limitations in updating the results of background checks in the system. There is a need to provide visibility into background checks being done for different organisations. Our customer also wants to proactively identify bottlenecks in the process and take action accordingly.

Solution:

This solution was built on SAP Analytics Cloud. It summarises the status of ongoing background checks across diverse segments and demographics. It also provides the vendor liaison officer with an overview of operations. A user-friendly interface allows for the quick identification of bottlenecks in the system, so the early mitigation of problems becomes possible.
