## Descripton
Business Challenge:

Singapore’s vulnerability to rising sea levels as an island state has always been on the national agenda, putting concerns of planet warming emissions in particularly sharp focus. Some estimations of Singapore’s carbon emission are available in public sources including government websites. However, sector-wise splits and related details are not easily available. For this dashboard we have made some reasonable estimates based on online literature, reviews and publicly available information. Although in certain sections, dummy data was used for representational purposes

Solution:

The solution built on SAP Analytics Cloud, summarizes data from 5 main emission categories— energy production, industrial emissions, transportation, public facilities and residential buildings. It highlights top contributors, historical and forecasted emission trends, location analysis, the consequential extent of various carbon emissions and other similar insights. “What If” scenarios were also taken into account, where potential emission data was simulated and measured against a target value to better understand how exactly we can reduce future emissions, and to identify where quick wins can be achieved.
