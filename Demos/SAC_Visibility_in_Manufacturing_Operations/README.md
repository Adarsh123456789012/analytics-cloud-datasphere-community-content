## Descripton
Business Challenge:
The dashboard needed to be comprehensive, so that it could provide end-to-end visibility into the company's manufacturing operations. Moreover, it needed to serve a range of stakeholders, such as the Production Head, Maintenance Head and Plant Head, all of whom have unique needs and goals. It was also crucial for stakeholders to gain smart insights quickly from this mountain of data, so that issues could be quickly identified and rectified before production could be affected.

Solution:
Our solution is an SAC dashboard covering a range of metrics, including maintenance-related metrics such as equipment availability, equipment performance and equipment quality. Insights can be generated quickly as a result of effective data visualisations and the use of colour-coding. Deeper dives into data can be conducted easily. In a few clicks, the user can learn about the root causes behind equipment breakdowns and their severity. Finally, the Kaizen page enables feedback loops in the organisation for the continuous and holistic improvement of operations.
